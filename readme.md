# Great Converto

This service allows transcoding the media files.
Basically ffmpeg as a service.

Development still at very early stage.


## Usage

Checkout, install dependencies with `npm install` and start the app with `npm run start`.

This starts server at `http://localhost:3000`.
Currently the input file will always be converted to mp4.
