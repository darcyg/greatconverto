# Great Converto

This service allows transcoding the media files.
Basically ffmpeg as a service.

Development still at very early stage.


## Usage

Checkout, install dependencies with `npm install` and start the app with `npm run start`.

This allows you to go to `http://localhost:3000/api/convert` and upload a file.
Currently it will be converted to mp4 (no way to fetch a file yet - just lands in tmp dir).


<!--
